# Wan2GP - AI Video Generation Template

#### Last Updated on 7/22/2025 to Wan2GP v7.12

## What is Wan2GP?

WAN2GP (aka "Wan 2.1 for the GPU Poor") is a free, open-source tool that lets you generate videos using advanced AI models—even on modest GPUs. Wan2GP supports multiple state-of-the-art models including:

- **Text-to-Video**: Create videos from text prompts
- **Image-to-Video**: Animate static images
- **Multitalk**: Animate multiple characters in the same scene with different voices

## What This Template Provides

This RunPod template is an extenstion of the official Runpod Pytorch 2.8.0 template. It gives you a fully configured environment with:

- ✅ **Wan2GP Application** - Ready to use on port 7860
- ✅ **Jupyter Lab** - Development environment on port 8888
- ✅ **All Dependencies** - PyTorch, FFmpeg, and required python libraries pre-installed
- ✅ **Storage** - Your models and outputs saved to `/workspace`

## Quick Start

### 1. Launch Your Pod

- **CUDA Version**: Make sure you use a machine that has **CUDA 12.8** installed (use additional filters when selecting machine)
- **Recommended**: This template was tested with an A40

### 2. Wait for Startup (Important!)

- ⏱️ **The application takes a few minutes to fully start** after your pod boots. This is normal.

### 3. Access Your Applications

#### Wan2GP Interface

1. Wait for startup to complete
2. Connect to port **7860**
3. Start generating videos! Note that on the first run of a model (when you hit "generate"), the model is downloaded which can take a few additional minutes. The next time you generate with the same model, the model is already there and the generation can start right away.

#### Jupyter Lab (Optional)

1. Connect to port **8888**
2. Get the access token: Connect via SSH or the web terminal and run:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep jupyter
   ```
3. Look for `--ServerApp.token=XXXXXX` in the output
4. Use that token to log into Jupyter Lab

## Troubleshooting

### Application Not Loading?

```bash
# Check if services are running
tail -f /workspace/wan2gp.log

# Restart if needed (rare)
cd /workspace/Wan2GP
python3 wgp.py --server-name 0.0.0.0
```

### Out of Space?

- Increase your **Volume Storage** (not Container Disk)
- Clean up old outputs in `/workspace/outputs`
- Remove unused models from `/workspace/models`
- Remove old logs at `/worskpace/wan2gp.log`
